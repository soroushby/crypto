      <p>
        A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency
        designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that
        is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank,
        to uphold or maintain it. It is a decentralized system for verifying
        that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have,
        eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when
        funds are being transferred between two entities.
